This is the solution directory for the PGdP Exercises for the winter semester 2019/2020

Keep in mind: these solutions are NOT the official solutions for the Exercises, but rather how I would approach the programming exercise at hand.

You can also find shortened and translated (English) problem statements for the different exercises.

Homework exercises will be uploaded after deadline (monday afternoon) and tutor exercises will be uploaded on thursday evening.

You can find my tutor course on thursdays, 12-15PM in the room 02.09.023.
