This is the solution directory for the PGdP Exercises for the winter semester 2019/2020

Keep in mind: these solutions are NOT the official solutions for the Exercises, but rather how I would approach the programming exercise at hand.
Some of the solutions may use the official solution as reference or base.

You can also find shortened and translated (English) problem statements for the different exercises.
EDIT: I am not allowed to post the translations anymore, it was explicitly forbidden by course administration.

Homework exercises will be uploaded after deadline (monday afternoon) and tutor exercises will be uploaded on thursday evening.
EDIT: This upload schedule is also going to vary due to personal scheduling issues.

You can find my tutor course on thursdays, 12-15PM in the room 02.09.023.
