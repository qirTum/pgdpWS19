This exercise is about showing whether a number is a palindrome or not
  -A number is a palindrome if the value of the number is the same when read backwards and forwards

The user is to be asked for a positive number until he enters one.
The entered number is to be converted into an array of digits and checked for the properties of a palindrome
The number is not allowed to be changed into a String at any time
You are not to use external methods except for MiniJava
To pass the tests, the formatting of the strings need to be exact.

Use the following Strings:
  -Enter number: "Geben Sie eine Zahl n >= 0 ein."
  -Palindrome: "Palindrom"
  -Not a palindrome: "Kein Palindrom"
